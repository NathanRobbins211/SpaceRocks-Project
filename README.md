# About SpaceRocks Project
A demo C++ program that utilizes the SDL libraries to create a simple top-down shooter game.
Use the arrow keys to move and rotate, and spacebar to shoot.
Enemies (asteriods) spawn outside of the screen and wrap around when exiting the screen.
Touching the enemies will cause the player character to die, while shooting the enemies will award the player with points (shown on console).
Large enemies split into smaller enemies when destroyed.
